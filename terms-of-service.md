# Terms of Service

_Last updated: 15/November/2024_

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our Discord bot. By using our bot, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Acceptable Use

You agree not to use the bot for any unlawful or abusive purposes. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Spamming
- Harassing other users
- Using the bot to violate Discord's terms of service or any European laws.

## 2. Banning and Blacklisting

- The bot logs ban, warn, and mute data to maintain a record of user behavior.
- If a user is banned in 5 servers where the bot is active, they will be blacklisted from using the bot.
- There is also a blacklist file that the bot's owner can manually modify to blacklist a user regardless of the number of bans.
- Users will only be informed of their blacklist status when they attempt to use a command while blacklisted.

## 3. Modifications to the Service

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the bot at any time with a notice of 2 weeks. With exception of:
- The bot's code being lost.
- The server getting destroyed and there being no other way to host the bot.
- Any situation where the developer's health and mental state is more important than the code of the bot.

## 4. Changes to the Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify users by posting a notice in our support server and publishing it to all follower channels that make use of Discord's follow-webhook.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact us by opening a ticket in our support server or contact newton.business@gmx.it for more info.
